	<!--  3 types of javascripts
	 1.  internal
	 2.  external
	 3.  inline
	 The reason we put javascript on the bottom of the page at the very end of the body, just before the closing body tag is so that it loads first, you have less cacheing, and it runs faster.  This all adds up to a more responsive site. -->

	 <!-- 3 Data types in Javascript
	 1.  String 
	 	example: var variable name=variable value
	 	var favorite_soda = 'Diet Coke';

	 	You can end in single quotes or double quotes, just as long as they're teh same on both sides.

	 	2.  Numbers
	 	Do not require quotation mark.  Only need the ending semi-colon.  Your number can be a decimal or exponential. 

	 	3.  Boolean
		These are binary values.  True/False; Yes/No; 1/0  
		If you put quotes around it, it becomes a string rather than a boolean value.  It will not do math operations.

		4.  Arrays
		Insert into brackets as shown above.  An array is literally a list of unordered things.  

		To pull data from an array an array, enter the array name [index number]

		Another way to pull data from an array is using console log as shown above

		Another way to pull data out on array is using an alert.  If you use an alert, it will lock the screen up for the user until after the lert is responded to.

		5.  Objects
		Uses curly brackets.  
		In the console you will have to type the object name followed by a period, and then  follow each period with the parameter you're trying to pull out.

		In console:
		camera.owner.profession 
		will return the value 
		"Not a videographer"

		camera.attachments[2]
		will return the value
		"Aux Power"
